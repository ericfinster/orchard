Orchard is an experiment in designing a proof assistant for higher category theory.

The fundamental intuition underlying its design is that when we reason categorically,
we reason using diagrams, and that one possible approach to detangling the mess that
is the current state of higher category theory is to accept this as a fact, and promote
diagrammatic reasoning to the status of a syntax for a logical theory.

Moreover, another fundamental philisophical standpoint which Orchard takes is that the
theory of higher categories should be ammenable to an *elementary* description.  That 
is to say, a description which falls outside the realm of set theory, and starts from
completely primitive notions which can be explained from first principles.
